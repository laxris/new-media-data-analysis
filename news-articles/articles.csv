The strong demand environment of the last few months has allowed several semiconductor players to enter into long-term, preferred supplier or other special relationships with customers. This has improved visibility for players and stabilized revenue streams. However, the industry remains supply constrained, which is a limiting factor. Growth prospects over the next 5-10 years are excellent, because of the adoption of new technologies like AI-ML, EVs, smart cities, IoT, etc.
While the longer-term outlook is extremely bright, near-term concerns related to the Fed-engineered economic slowdown and supply challenges remain. The most likely result will be increased caution at customers, who could order closer to consumption, thus reducing visibility. But this should not be a deterrent considering that there are segments of the market that remain amazingly resilient.
Our current picks are Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).
About the Industry
This industry includes mostly semiconductor chip manufacturers like Intel Corporation (INTC).
Major Themes for the Industry
This is likely to be a mixed year for semiconductor companies offering analog and mixed signal chips. Some end markets will be sluggish. PCs (gradual uptick expected in the second half on the enterprise side and continued softness on the consumer side) and smartphones (weak consumer spending due to inflation affecting disposable income, as well as greater propensity to consume things like leisure and travel) stand out here. However, other markets like automotive, communications (especially 5G), IoT, cloud, AI, industrial (including medical devices) are all expected to do well. Technological innovation in the form of the metaverse, digital health, EVs and other innovative transportation and sustainability considerations are other drivers. China opening up is a positive, but uncertainties related to dealing with China remain.
The industry is likely to see continued operating challenges. Primary among these is the supply/demand imbalance that is leading to an inventory glut especially in DRAM and NAND chips that have not been consumed as PC and smartphone demand slumped. Data center demand has also dropped off sharper than expected as leading tech players absorbed the reduction in advertising demand. On the other hand, the shortage of chips for the automotive market remains. The situation is expected to gradually improve as we get into the second half partly because some of the demand is expected to come back, partly because of increasing capacity and partly because of other factors such as the end of support for Windows 10 leading to another upgrade cycle in the PC market.
An emerging issue that semiconductor players are particularly exposed to is geopolitical tensions. The semiconductor supply chain is globally distributed, which means that international relations need to be maintained to ensure that work continues without disruption. While the Russia-Ukraine war didn’t have that much of an impact, the souring of relations between the U.S. and China is another story. If China really tries to take control of Taiwan as many experts expect it will, there could be a terrible war that will be highly disruptive of the global economy and especially of the chip sector. That’s because a leading share of advanced node chips are made on the island. Another geopolitical concern is the increasing awareness among all leading nations of the increasingly larger role that semiconductors are playing in AI-driven electronic weaponry and surveillance mechanisms. As semiconductors become important in defense, the need to onshore or near-shore production is being felt. This is leading to rebalancing of the semiconductor supply chain not with a cost-reduction perspective but with a far more strategic objective. So the government is trying to incentivize companies to build in the U.S. TSM, the main supplier to the U.S. is setting up in the country but the plan is to have this on a much larger scale. The CHIPS Act may help a difficult situation where increased capacity would depress prices while U.S. production would increase costs. In the meantime, the U.S. has ordered restrictions on trading with China, which is also a near-term headwind for players.

3 Stocks to Hold for the Long-Term
Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI): Analog Devices is an original equipment manufacturer of semiconductor devices, specifically, analog, mixed signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits for industrial, consumer, communications and automotive customers. Other than manufacturing at its facilities in the U.S., Ireland and Southeast Asia, it also outsources some production to outside foundries, mainly Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for front-end processing and third-party subcontractors for back-end operations.
Analog Devices’ strength in the more resilient industrial (over 50% revenue share) and automotive markets is proving to be helpful in the difficult operating climate we are seeing today. Demand in these markets, particularly for automation and electrification are currently driving its business. These along with pervasive sensing, AI-driven edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity that are enabling new capabilities, applications and markets at the Intelligent Edge are secular drivers.
As far as operations are concerned, the company has been growing its output both internally and at its foundry partners, which has allowed it to lower lead times. However, it still has a significant backlog, which would translate into a year’s revenue at the current level.
Shipments are expected to increase through the year, bringing the backlog back to normal levels. The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 13%, making it the fifth consecutive double-digit increase, and the 19th straight year of dividend increase.
The company beat January quarter estimates by 6.2% and in the last 30 days, the 2023 estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company dropped a couple of cents The 2024 estimate increased by 90 cents (9.0%).
The shares are up 25.3% over the past year.
Price and Consensus: ADI

Microchip Technology Inc. (MCHP): Microchip Technology Incorporated operates in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It develops, manufactures and sells smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions such as general purpose 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit microcontrollers; 32-bit embedded microprocessors; and specialized microcontrollers for automotive, industrial, computing, communications, lighting, power supplies, motor control, human machine interface, security, wired connectivity and wireless connectivity applications.
Microchip’s demand far outpaces its ability to supply. It is a good thing that more than 50% of its backlog is non-cancellable under its Preferred Supply Program (PSP). Other than the fact that it greatly improves visibility, it also helps in the current environment where supply constraints are only now beginning to ease up.
Management is currently focused on bringing down its backlog while maintaining the quality of new orders. As supply continues to improve and lead times come down, profitability will also improve. However, China’s imposing and then suddenly raising its lockdown has resulted in inventory gluts that are an overhang on Microchip’s business.
Investors would be interested to know that its strong cash flows have enabled the company to pay down a substantial portion of its debt over the last few years and also pay a consistent dividend. The company recently announced a 41.5% increase in the quarterly dividend. Therefore management continues to return value to shareholders.
Microchip beat estimates by 0.7% in the last quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 has increased 7 cents (1.2%) in the last 60 days. The 2024 estimate increased 35 cents (6.0%) during the same period.
#2 ranked Microchip’s shares are up 19.3% over the past year.
Price and Consensus: MCHP

Silicon Laboratories Inc. (SLAB): Silicon Laboratories is a fabless semiconductor company offering wireless microcontrollers and sensor products primarily in the U.S., China and Taiwan. Its products are used in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications, including connected home and security, industrial automation and control, smart metering, smart lighting, commercial building automation, consumer electronics, asset tracking and medical instrumentation.
Silicon Laboratories is seeing solid momentum in its business, which has allowed it to double its organic revenue in two years and increase its design wins by 120%. Management continues to see significant opportunity and expects the design win momentum to continue, further building its leadership position in IoT, despite the macroeconomic uncertainties.
Silicon Laboratories topped the Zacks Consensus earnings estimate by 35.1% in the last quarter. Its 2023 EPS estimate has jumped a dollar (25.3%) in the last 60 days while the 2024 estimate increased 49 cents (9.0%).
Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 stock are up 26.2% over the past year.

“There is a lot of stress on the semiconductor supply chain and there is no sign of easing,” said the Fuji Electric India CEO in a chat with CNBC-TV18, “I don’t see an end to the shortage in the near future.”
He added that manufacturing of EVs is applying more stress on semiconductor supplies, and although several companies are increasing manufacturing capacity, this will take time.
Across the world, the semiconductor supply crisis persists even as chip manufacturers in China and Taiwan saw their capacities impacted last year thanks to long COVID-19 lockdowns. Today, these suppliers are contending with a logjam due to a long list of pending orders and supply chain interruptions.
“The average semiconductor sourcing lead time today is anywhere between six months to two years,” said Waghmare, adding, “Some chips have sourcing lead times that are beyond two years.” He added that predicting when sourcing timelines would shrink was a difficult task.
On Wednesday, Fuji Electric India announced the commencement of operations at a new plant in Chennai. The group has invested Rs 150 crore in establishing the plant, which comes with capacities of 120,000 drives and 200,000 PCB units. The launch now means Fuji Electric is set to hit a revenue milestone of Rs 1,500 crore in India by FY25.
“The manufacturing, sourcing and R&D capabilities at the new plant will ensure that we make cost-effective products,” said Waghmare, “The company has been growing at 30 to 35 percent in India, and we are looking to further invest around Rs 300 to 400 crore in this market.”
The recent budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crore towards renewable energy projects comes as good news for electric component firms such as Fuji Electric. “But we can register growth of 20 to 25 percent even without such government incentives,” Waghmare said.
A customs duty waiver on import of components for manufacture of lithium ion batteries also comes as good news to the company owing to investments in EVs and data centres.

The Commerce Department wants stakeholders’ “best ideas” for new research and manufacturing hubs for computer chips that could transform communities nationwide.
The federal government is planning to make $500 million available later this spring under last year’s CHIPS and Science Act that could transform communities around the country through the creation of new research and manufacturing hubs for semiconductors.
But first, officials from the U.S. Department of Commerce are asking for input from the public as they consider a number of key questions in designing the program. The questions include what criteria to use in picking who will receive funding, how to help those areas be successful in creating future generations of semiconductors, and how to measure their success.
“We're asking you for the best ideas, the best examples, best practices because we want to make sure that this effort is successful,” Alejandra Castillo, the assistant Commerce secretary for economic development told Route Fifty in an interview last week.
The $54.2 billion bipartisan bill passed by Congress last July is mainly known for providing billions in subsidies to encourage semiconductor companies to build the computer chips used in everything from smartphones to refrigerators here in the United States. But the bill also calls for spending $10 billion to create the hubs.
Under the law, the hubs are envisioned as consortiums of different kinds of entities that would be involved in doing research to create innovations in the industry and to build the chips.
“A tech hub is a collection of economic drivers in a region,” Castillo said. “It's not a building. It's not one particular entity. It's really an interconnected ecosystem that supports critical emerging technology.”
The consortiums, she said, might be partnerships involving universities, the private sector, nonprofits, unions, community colleges and philanthropy. “All of these different stakeholders have a role to play in the creation of these tech hubs,” she said.
Significantly, under the law, the hubs will not be created in areas like Silicon Valley where technology has already become an important part of their economies.
A 2019 Brookings Metro report found that because industries tend to cluster together, 90% of the increase in jobs in industries that rely on innovation, between 2005 and 2017, occurred in only five “superstar” metropolitan areas—Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle and San Diego.
As a result, one-third of the innovation jobs are concentrated in only 16 of the nation’s 3,006 counties. More than half of the jobs are in only 41 counties.
To reverse that trend, the law requires the Commerce Department to “ensure geographic and demographic diversity” by creating at least three hubs in each of the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s six regional offices.
At least a third of the hubs will have to “significantly benefit a small and rural community,” which the law defines as a metropolitan area with no more than 250,000 people. In addition, at least one of the 20 hubs has to be in a low-population state that does not have an urbanized area with at least 250,000 people.
“This is the type of transformational economic change that can really take a region into the industries of tomorrow,” Castillo said.
Echoing Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s remarks last month in laying out the criteria the department will use to award subsidies to companies, Castillo said the hubs will also support the nation’s security by decreasing its dependence on semiconductors built in China.
Congress, as part of its $1.7 billion omnibus spending bill last December, provided funding for the first $500 million of the project. President Joe Biden in his budget proposal last week asked Congress to approve the next $4 billion in the next spending bill.
The department hasn’t decided how the first tranche of money will be split up, Castillo said. The department is planning to make money available in the Notice of Funding Opportunity it issues in late spring. Some of the money will go to helping consortiums develop their plans. The department will designate the nation’s first hubs, although how many hasn’t been decided on yet, according to Castillo. Some of the funds will also go to help the first hubs implement their plans.
But before starting the application process, the Commerce Department is designing the program, as well as another program that will help areas with lower labor participation rates get involved. The department is seeking input for both these programs.
More immediately, it issued a Request for Information last month as it considers how “a region that has different types of assets can come together to really propel the economy of that particular region,” Castillo said. “I'm making everyone else send us their best thoughts, their ideas, their best practices of what they believe are successful.”
The public has until this Thursday, March 16, to give their thoughts on key questions, like:
- What are the defining features of a region that indicate that a tech hub will take hold, and how will the Economic Development Administration (EDA) know if a tech hub succeeds?
- What existing assets and resources that generate, support, and enable technology innovation, demonstration and deployment should tech hubs have?
- When designating tech hubs, what additional geographic, demographic, or other place-specific factors or data should the EDA consider?
- Are there specific metrics that the EDA should consider for designating tech hubs?
In addition, the Commerce Department is also asking for input on questions on how to help the hubs succeed, including:
- What are historical and existing examples of successful regional hub programs and what can be learned from these examples?
- Are there statutory, regulatory, policy, design or implementation issues with current EDA programs or operations that inhibit or prohibit EDA in some way?
- Are there specific workforce and labor development, business and entrepreneurial development, technology development and maturation, or infrastructure activities that the EDA should emphasize through the program?
The department is also in the process of figuring out how to spend the first $200 million of the $1 billion Distressed Area Recompete Pilot Program, which seeks to allow areas with lower labor participation rates take part in growing the semiconductor industry.
The department is asking for input by March 27, on questions like:
- What barriers should be addressed to increase job placement/retention and/or job creation? What unique challenges and opportunities do you see in your community?
- Given that the law limits the size of grants to communities to $20 million, what types of initial investments would most significantly increase employment rates?
The program is of “critical importance,” Castillo said. “We're always looking at economic development with a lens towards equity. And equity is not just looking at urban and rural America, but also looking at indigenous communities, looking at coal communities and making sure that we don't leave anyone behind.”

"WATCH LIVE","2023-03-09","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/dutch-to-restrict-semiconductor-tech-exports-to-china-joining-us.html","The Netherlands' government on Wednesday said it plans new restrictions on exports of semiconductor technology to protect national security, joining the U.S. effort to curb chip exports to China.
The announcement marked the first concrete move by the Dutch, who oversee essential chipmaking technology, toward adopting rules urged by Washington to hobble China's chipmaking industry and slow its military advances.
The U.S. in October imposed sweeping export restrictions on shipments of American chipmaking tools to China, but for the restrictions to be effective it needs other key suppliers in the Netherlands and Japan, who produce key chipmaking technology, to agree. The allied countries have been in talks on the matter for months.
Dutch Trade Minister Liesje Schreinemacher announced the decision in a letter to parliament, saying the restrictions will be introduced before the summer.
Her letter did not name China, a key Dutch trading partner, nor did it name ASML, Europe's largest tech firm and a major supplier to semiconductor manufacturers, but both will be affected. It specified one technology that will be impacted is ""DUV"" lithography systems, the second-most advanced machines that ASML sells to computer chip manufacturers.
""Because the Netherlands considers it necessary on national security grounds to get this technology into oversight with the greatest of speed, the Cabinet will introduce a national control list,"" the letter said.
A White House representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ASML said in a response it expects to have to apply for licenses to export the most advanced segment among its DUV machines, but that would not impact its 2023 financial guidance.
ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, multimillion dollar machines that use powerful lasers to create the minute circuitry of computer chips.
The company expects sales in China to remain about flat at 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in 2023 — implying relative shrinkage as the company expects overall sales to grow by 25%. Major ASML customers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are engaged in capacity expansions.
ASML has never sold its most advanced ""EUV"" machines to customers in China, and the bulk of its ""DUV"" sales in China go to relatively less advanced chipmakers. Its biggest South Korean customers, Samsung and SK Hynix both have significant manufacturing capacity in China.
The Dutch announcement leaves major questions unanswered, including whether ASML will be able to service the more than 8 billion euros worth of DUV machines it has sold to customers in China since 2014.
Schreinemacher said the Dutch government had decided on measures ""as carefully and precisely as possible ... to avoid unnecessary disruption of value chains.""
""It is for companies of importance to know what they are facing and to have time to adjust to new rules,"" she wrote.
Japan is expected to issue an update on its chip equipment export policies as soon as this week.","Dutch to restrict semiconductor tech exports to China, joining U.S. effort","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/dutch-to-restrict-semiconductor-tech-exports-to-china-joining-us.html","https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/09/dutch-to-restrict-semiconductor-tech-exports-to-china-joining-us.html"
"Stuart Gentle Publisher","2023-03-14","https://www.onrec.com/news/news-archive/the-semiconductor-industry-needs-hr-professionals-now-more-than-ever-here%E2%80%99s-why","From tablets and phones to household appliances and smart machines, several electronic devices operate with semiconductor-based chips at their core. And so, when the semiconductor shortage hit the entire tech and engineering industry post-COVID, it devastated the whole supply chain for these products: companies that manufacture chips and those that use them took major hits in product development.
Now, there’s an active movement to scale up chip manufacturing across the world, with the US leading the charge. In the coming months, the demand for talent in this industry will reach new highs, leaving companies to expend many resources in outbidding other companies for a top-tier workforce. Thus, there will also be a demand for HR professionals who can find and keep the right talent.
The Semiconductor Shortage
The semiconductor shortage was sparked mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic, with several dispersed but connected incidents happening simultaneously. The lockdowns led to an inability for chip manufacturing plants to function at full capacity due to a staff shortage. At the same time, demand for chip-based devices and electronic gadgets shot up worldwide, leading to more requests from manufacturers to chipmaking firms.
All of these happened while the global semiconductor supply chain was disrupted by bans on international movement, meaning that raw materials could only move slowly to their next destination. And to top it all off, there was a major monopoly in the industry: a CyberGhost article on PCs reported that more than half of semiconductor demand was directed to TSMC — including demand from large companies like Apple and Intel. The high demand has caused major price increases in semiconductors and scalping, which has affected many industries that rely on this scarce commodity to produce.
The Need for Talent
Recently, the industry has been learning from these occurrences and charting a new direction. In the US, President Joe Biden is leading efforts to expand home-based semiconductor manufacturing with the CHIPS Act, commissioning a $39 billion fund to erect facilities for chipmaking. Several US companies are already on board with the movement, which could significantly reduce supply chain costs.
Of course, with this will come an explosive demand for talent in the high-tech field. Given that arstechnica reports that the US is already experiencing a labor shortage in the chip manufacturing facilities on its home turf, it’s clear that the plan to expand these facilities depends on finding and training the right people. As companies emerge, they will also be on the lookout for highly skilled HR managers who can convey their mission to professionals and bring such people on board.
Diversifying the Industry
There’s a heavy emphasis on workforce values and benefits in the CHIPS Act, such as childcare provisions for employees. But one that also stands out is the need for increased diversity in the industry — and no party plays a more important role here than HR managers.

Is ON Semiconductor Corporation's (NASDAQ:ON) Latest Stock Performance Being Led By Its Strong Fundamentals?
ON Semiconductor's (NASDAQ:ON) stock is up by 8.7% over the past three months. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study ON Semiconductor's ROE in this article.
ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?
Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for ON Semiconductor is:
31% = US$1.9b ÷ US$6.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).
The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.31 in profit.
What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.
ON Semiconductor's Earnings Growth And 31% ROE
First thing first, we like that ON Semiconductor has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 19% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Under the circumstances, ON Semiconductor's considerable five year net income growth of 21% was to be expected.
Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that ON Semiconductor's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 28% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is ON worth today?

Is ON Semiconductor Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?
ON Semiconductor doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.
Summary
On the whole, we feel that ON Semiconductor's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.
